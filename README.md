- [Intermediate_Python](#intermediate_python)
- [Advanced_Python](#advanced_python)

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Beginner_Python**: Contains code for basic Python concepts.
- **Object_Oriented**: Contains code for Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- **Intermediate_Python**: Contains code for intermediate-level Python concepts.
- **Advanced_Python**: Contains code for advanced Python topics.

## Beginner_Python

The `Beginner_Python` folder contains Python files that cover the foundational concepts of Python. Each file is named based on the topic it covers and is self-explanatory. Below is a list of the files and what they contain:

- **conditions.py**: Handling conditions and boolean logic.
- **data_types.py**: Understanding Python data types.
- **for_loops.py**: Using `for` loops in Python.
- **functions.py**: Defining and using functions.
- **if_elif_else.py**: Implementing conditional statements.
- **iteration.py**: Exploring iteration concepts in Python.
- **lists.py**: Working with lists.
- **modular.py**: Demonstrating modular programming.
- **optional_parameter.py**: Using optional parameters in functions.
- **other_methods.py**: Additional built-in Python methods.
- **read_file.py**: Reading files in Python.
- **write_file.py**: Writing to files in Python.
- **slice_operator.py**: Using slice operator with sequences.
- **string_methods.py**: Applying string methods.
- **try_except.py**: Exception handling using `try` and `except`.
- **while_loops.py**: Using `while` loops.

More folders and files will be added over time to cover intermediate, object-oriented, and advanced Python topics.
