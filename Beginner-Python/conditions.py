# Comparison Operators in Python
# These operators compare two values and return a Boolean result: True or False.

# "!=" checks if two values are not equal.
print("HELLO" != "hello")  # Output: True, because "HELLO" and "hello" differ in case.

# "==" checks if two values are equal.
print(2 + 4 == 6)  # Output: True, because 2 + 4 is equal to 6.

# ">=" checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
print(2 + 10 >= 12)  # Output: True, because 2 + 10 equals 12, which satisfies the "greater than or equal to" condition.

# ">" checks if the left value is strictly greater than the right value.
print(2 + 10 > 12)  # Output: False, because 2 + 10 equals 12, which is not strictly greater than 12.

# "==" checks if two Boolean values are equal.
print(False == True)  # Output: False, because False and True are not equal.
