x = 5
y = "string"

# x is the instance of the class int whose value is 5
# y is the instance of the class str whose value is string

# In Python, object is pretty much anything

# Whenever we create anything in Python, it is an object

print(y.upper())

# I don't know whether you know it or not but a method is actually what you call with a dot (.) operator like .upper() in the above case

# a method is anything that you are calling an object itself

# function is something that is going to take an object and apply and operation to it
